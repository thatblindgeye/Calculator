This is my calculator project for The Odin Project. Check out the live preview of my <a href="">Calculator</a>.

Features include:

1. Toggle between a Dark Theme (default) and a Light Theme using the theme button (sun icon)
2. Both click/touch and keyboard support
3. A history tab, showing the 20 most recent calculations entered
4. Numbers are rounded to 5 decimal places, if present
5. Two display areas: an equation area (will show "2 + 2 =") and an input/result area (will show
   current numerical input or the result of "4", if = or Enter is pressed)
6. The font size of the input/result will auto-adjust depending on the length of the number
