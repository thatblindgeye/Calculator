This is my calculator project for The Odin Project.

Check out the live preview of my <a href="https://thatblindgeye.github.io/Calculator/">Calculator</a>.

Features include:

1. A button (sun icon) to switch between a Dark Theme (default) and a Light Theme
2. Click/touch as well as keyboard support:
   All Clear: press c
   Toggle Negative: press n
   Toggle Theme: press t
   Toggle History: press h
3. A history tab, showing the 20 most recent calculations entered
4. Numbers are rounded or returned as an exponential when the length is longer than 16 characters
5. Two display areas: an equation area that will show "2 + 2 =", and an input/result area that will show
   the current numerical input, or the result of "4" if =/Enter is pressed.
6. The font size of the input/result will auto-adjust depending on the length of the number
